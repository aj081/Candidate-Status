# Candidate-Status
HR Works supports several information technology (IT) companies in India with their talent acquisition. One of the challenges they face is about 30% of the candidates who accept the jobs offer do not join the company. This leads to huge loss of revenue and time as the companies initiate the recruitment process again to fill the workforce demand. HR Works wants to find if a model can be built to predict the likelihood of a candidate joining the company.
