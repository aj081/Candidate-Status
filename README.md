# Candidate-Status
HR Works supports several information technology (IT) companies in India with their talent acquisition. One of the challenges they face is about 30% of the candidates who accept the jobs offer do not join the company. This leads to huge loss of revenue and time as the companies initiate the recruitment process again to fill the workforce demand. HR Works wants to find if a model can be built to predict the likelihood of a candidate joining the company.

Negligence to join a company from the candidate side can cause a serious issue, considerig the fact that the company will have to go through the same process of hiring from beginning which leads to considerable loss in revenuue and time.From the data presented by the company, we can see that the major functions which explains the basic context of candidate mindset is 'years of experience' and 'Percent difference CTC'. The rest relationships can be later analysed.
